# Puppy Provenance
My final Project written for my Databases Class in concert w/ Robert Hughes.

Provides SQL for creating database tables and inserting example data.

Creates a simple browser CRUD for interacting with a multi-table database. The database is an immitation of what one might implement should they have a dog breeding business and need to keep track of puppies, parents, and clients.

Provides sample complex queries for demonstration of understanding of SQL.
